Operator: Welcome, everyone. Thank you for standing by for the Alphabet Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Jim Friedland: Thank you, good afternoon everyone and welcome to Alphabet's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Anat Ashkenazi. Now, I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and finiancial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of riks and uncertainties. Acutal results could differ materially. Please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP finanical measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. And now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar.

Sundar Pichai: Thank you, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. This was a terrific quarter for Alphabet, driven by double-digit growth across every major part of our business. We are seeing AI now driving real business results across the company. We delivered our first-ever $100 billion dollar quarter. Five years ago, our quarterly revenue was at $50 billion. Our revenue number has doubled since then, and we're firmly in the generative AI era.
